# Amro K Saleh Portfolio

This is my portfolio website built with [Astro](https://astro.build). It is a static site that is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You can view the live site [here](https://amroksaleh.netlify.app/).

## About Me

I love to call myself a creator. I love to create stuff such as movies, software, devices, crafts, etc.
I take pride in my work and I am always looking to improve myself and my skills. I love learning new stuff and actually, I find it calming to learn a new skill.
